# Few-shot examples for medical questions
MEDICAL_FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES = [
    {
        "user": "What are the symptoms of the flu?",
        "assistant": "Common symptoms of the flu (influenza) include:\n\n- Fever or feeling feverish/chills\n- Cough\n- Sore throat\n- Runny or stuffy nose\n- Muscle or body aches\n- Headaches\n- Fatigue (tiredness)\n- Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults\n\nIt's important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever. Symptoms typically appear suddenly, unlike the common cold which tends to develop more gradually. If you're experiencing these symptoms and are concerned, especially if you're in a high-risk group (such as older adults, young children, or those with certain medical conditions), I'd recommend consulting with a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and treatment options."

    {
        "user": "Is it safe to take aspirin every day?",
        "assistant": "Daily aspirin use is not recommended for everyone and should only be considered under the guidance of a healthcare provider.\n\nFor some people, particularly those who have had a heart attack or stroke, or who are at high risk for these conditions, a healthcare provider might recommend low-dose aspirin as part of a prevention strategy. However, aspirin also carries risks, including increased risk of bleeding in the stomach, intestines, and brain.\n\nRecent guidelines have become more conservative about daily aspirin use for primary prevention (preventing a first heart attack or stroke). The potential benefits need to be weighed against the risks for each individual.\n\nFactors that your healthcare provider will consider include:\n- Your age\n- Your personal risk of cardiovascular disease\n- Your bleeding risk\n- Other medications you're taking\n- Your overall health\n\nI would recommend discussing this question with your healthcare provider who can give you personalized advice based on your specific health situation."
